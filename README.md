-How to compile the code

javac parser.java
javac client.java
javac statistics.java
javac conn.java
javac tester.java
java tester <XML file>

-XML library

We use an xml parser for this project.

The test.txt xml file is sure to work fine

The icons folder should be in the directory of node document-root and it has all the icons the code uses.
